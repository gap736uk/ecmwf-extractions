File-Naming Convention for BADC MARS job templates
==================================================

All MARS templates follow the convention:


  DATASET-GRIDTYPE-LEVELTYPE[-OTHER]
  
Where:

DATASET is the ECMWF dataset code:
 op = Operational
 e40 = ERA-40

GRIDTYPE is the type of grid resolution:
 2.5 = 2.5 x 2.5 regular lat/long grid
 1.125 = 1.125 x 1.125 regular lat/long grid 
 1.0 = 1.0 x 1.0 regular lat/long grid
 n80 = Full N80 Gaussian grid
 n80r = Reduced N80 Gaussian grid
 t106 = T106 Spectral Resolution
 t159 = T159 Spectral Resolution 
 
LEVELTYPE is the analysis/forecast specifier and level type:
 The first character is 'a' for analysis or 'f' for forecast
 The second character represents the level type:
   m = model levels
   p = pressure levels
   s = surface/single levels
   t = potential temperature levels
   v = potential vorticity levels
   
[-OTHER] can be used for additional information such as monthly 
mean specifications.
